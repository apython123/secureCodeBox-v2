## About
The ElasticSearch persistenceProvider hook saves all findings and reports into the configured ElasticSearch index. This allows for some easy searching and visualization of the findings. To learn more about Elasticsearch visit [elastic.io].

## Deployment

Installing the Elasticsearch persistenceProvider hook will add a _ReadOnly Hook_ to your namespace. 

```bash
helm upgrade --install elkh ./hooks/persistence-elastic/
```

## Configuration
